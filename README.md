# VIPhreeqc
Extension of the IPhreeqc 3.3.7 module ([Parkhurst&Appello](http://wwwbrr.cr.usgs.gov/projects/GWC_coupled/phreeqc/)).
This extension aims to add more flexibility to the IPhreeqc module by exposing more information to the C extension. Instead of relying on SELECTED_OUTPUT this extensions enables users to directly gather information such as the pH, SC, speciation, element totals etc. of solutions.

## Implemented Functionality
The following functions are implemented in addition to the standard IPhreeqc functionality:
```C
  /**
   * Returns the pH of the specified solution
   */
  double                  GetPH(int solution);
  /**
   * Returns the pe of the specified solution
   */
  double                  GetPe(int solution);
  /**
   * Returns the specific conductance (in uS/cm) of the specified solution
   */
  double                  GetSC(int solution);
  /**
   * Returns the amount (in mol) of an element (e.g. C(-4), Ca, etc.)
   */
  double                  GetTotal(int solution, const char *string);
  /**
   * Returns the total amount (in mol) of an element (e.g. C, Ca, etc.)
   */
  double                  GetTotalElement(int solution, const char *string);
  /**
   * Returns the amount of moles (in mol) of a species (e.g. Ca+2, OH-, etc.)
   */
  double                  GetMoles(int solution, const char *species);
  /**
   * Returns the molality (in mol/kgW) of a species (e.g. Ca+2, OH-, etc.)
   */
  double                  GetMolality(int solution, const char *species);
  /**
   * Returns a comma separated list of all the species in the selected solution
   */
  const char*             GetSpecies(int solution);
  /**
   * Returns the Solubility Index of a phase in a solution
   */
  double                  GetSI(int solution, const char *phase);
  /**
   * Returns a comma separated list of all the phases in the selected solution
   */
  const char*             GetPhases(int solution);
  /**
   * Returns a comma separated list of all the elements in the selected solution
   */
  const char*             GetElements(int solution);
```
### Error values
The following values are returned on error
```C
-99  = Invalid IPhreeqc Instance
-999 = Solution Not Found
```
